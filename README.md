# "Advanced-Robotics-Platform-BHAU" - Hardware Architecture for a 3-MCU Robotics Platform

This repository documents the hardware architecture for the "BHAU" advanced robotics platform. My primary role was leading the end-to-end hardware design and implementation.

*(Note: Due to team project policies, the full source code is not publicly available. The focus of this repository is to document the hardware architecture and my specific contributions.)*

## System Architecture
I architected a distributed control system using three specialized microcontrollers:
*   **STM32:** For real-time locomotion control.
*   **Arduino Mega:** For multi-axis actuation.
*   **ESP32:** For wireless communication.

*(A detailed system block diagram will be added shortly.)*

## Key Contributions
*   **Hardware Design:** Led the full hardware integration, including motors, drivers, and sensors.
*   **Power Systems:** Designed a custom multi-rail power distribution system with buck converters to ensure stable operation.
